### Fixes:

**Scarab green lighting fix:** In order for the Scarab to be viewed on your map in correct lighting you must place 'Spherical Harmonic Lighting' objects around your level. Once you have placed them, bake lighting on your map and the Scarab will use those points to remove the green lighting and be lit by the points.
